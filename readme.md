**Objective:** To enable the reading of radiotherapy plan DICOM files, calculation of dosimetric evaluation metrics, batch data extraction, and simple display of individual plans.

**Background:** Currently, the collection of dosimetric data in radiotherapy planning typically relies on the dose-volume histogram (DVH) module within the treatment planning system (TPS). This process involves manual sampling to obtain the dose or volume data corresponding to the tissues under evaluation from each plan's DVH curve. However, for certain specific evaluation metrics, such as conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), and gradient index (GI), manual calculations are still required. More importantly, in retrospective analyses of radiotherapy planning data, the collection of data from a large number of patient plans is extremely time-consuming and significantly occupies TPS clinical resources. Therefore, this program parses the plan DICOM files exported from TPS, enabling the automatic calculation of various dosimetric evaluation metrics and batch data extraction, providing convenience for radiotherapy research.
