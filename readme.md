**Objective:** To enable the reading of radiotherapy plan DICOM files, calculation of dosimetric evaluation metrics, batch data extraction, extraction of planning CT radiomics and dosomics features, structure Boolean operations, and simple display of individual plans.

**Background:** Currently, the collection of dosimetric data in radiotherapy planning typically relies on the dose-volume histogram (DVH) module within the treatment planning system (TPS). This process involves manual sampling to obtain the dose or volume data corresponding to the tissues under evaluation from each planâ€™s DVH curve. However, for certain specific evaluation metrics, such as the conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), and gradient index (GI), manual calculations are still required. Additionally, the conventional workflow for extracting dosomics and radiomics features can be complex. More importantly, in retrospective analyses of radiotherapy planning data, the collection of data from a large number of patient plans is extremely time-consuming and significantly occupies TPS clinical resources. Therefore, this program parses plan DICOM files exported from the TPS to enable the automatic calculation and batch extraction of various dosimetric evaluation metrics and -omics features, thereby facilitating radiotherapy research.
